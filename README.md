# Game Notes
Keep you game points in this app. Pikkes, Mpirimpa, Kougkas, Hearts, Kavourakia
The only game that works currently is Pikkes.

Add as many players as you like and then create a new game notes (just Pikkes for now)


### Pikkes
There are dropdowns in order to select the player's guess and the player's actual bazes.
When you are about to enter the guesses to the players, the person writing the notes have to click on the next and previous button to set the according guesses.  
When the actual the round is over then you can select the actual bazes by the dropdowns (no need to press the next and previous buttons).  
If a user did the correct amount of bazes just press the number of guesses (lef of the dropdown) to automatically select it in the dropdown.
